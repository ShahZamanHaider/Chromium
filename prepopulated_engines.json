// For more details see tools/json_to_struct/json_to_struct.py.

// Engine definitions. See prepopulated_engines_schema.json for the field
// definitions.

// NOTES:
//   - CHANGE THE BELOW NUMBERS IF YOU ADD A NEW ENGINE; ID conflicts = bad!
//     - Make sure you update the int_variables below as described in comments.
//     - IDs > 1000 are reserved for distribution custom engines.
//   - NOTIFY the Chrome Webstore team if you add/delete a search engine or
//     change domain of an existing one (send email to webstore-eng@google.com).
//     They need to know the mapping between an engine's "id" and its URLs.
//   - Use HTTPS URLs when adding new search engines or adding URLs to existing
//     ones. It's not the 90s anymore.
